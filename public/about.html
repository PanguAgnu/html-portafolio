  Hi!Im Brisa Itzel Bautista Chavez
  Im passionate about technology and design, always looking for ways to
  combine logic with creativity. I love working on projects that range
  from JavaFX applications with intuitive interfaces to interactive
  Arduino-based games. I enjoy learning and experimenting with new tools,
  exploring advanced features in environments like IntelliJ, and finding
  practical solutions that enhance the user experience.

  For me, every project is an opportunity to grow, innovate,
  and have fun along the way.
